Become part of the Contentful community by contributing content on **"how to build better websites"**

## What is the Contentful contribution program?

The Contentful contribution program gives you a platform to share your ideas with the Contentful community and the rest of the world. Let it be a blog post, a video tutorial or something we can not even think of, we want to hear from you and help you to create content that educates and inspires others to join the ["better way to build websites" movement](#what-does-building-better-websites-mean).

Our team of professional writers is there to support you in finding the best words and Contentful will distribute your piece so that it reaches the right people.

As a thank you, we will send you **a $100 Amazon voucher** and custom swag (socks, anyone?) and list you on [contentful.com](https://www.contentful.com) to make you a real Contentful community author.

## What does "building better websites" mean?

We believe that the future of the web is based on core technologies and **we want to publish content covering the following topics**:

- Static sites
- Serverless technologies
- Structured content (GraphQL)

**Contentful related how-to's and tutorials are also more than welcome!**

If you have any questions about a certain topic or any suggestions, you are welcome to add a comment to the respective issue.

## "I don't know what to write about!"

Finding the right topic is hard ‚Äì we know that. If you'd like to write for the Contentful blog but aren't quite sure about what to write about and need some inspiration, check out [the type of topics we would like to see blog posts about](https://github.com/contentful/contribution-program/issues) in this repository. They are labeled by their respective technologies for easy filtering and searching.

## How do I get started?

So you have an idea on what to write about and are totally stoked to get started? Open a new issue or comment on an existing one, and someone from **our developer relations team will reach out to you to discuss if your topic is a good fit**. If your topic is selected, we will move your story to [the project board](https://github.com/contentful/contribution-program/projects/1) and help you with everything you need.

Once you started writing, we'll make sure your topic is marked as `in progress` to avoid duplicate work.

### Create an outline to stay focused

Once your article is moved to `in progress`, we'd like you to first write an outline. Writing an article can sometimes be trickier than you think. That's why we think [a structured outline](./OUTLINE.md) will help you find the best possible narrative and stay focused in your writing.

### Labels define process and state
