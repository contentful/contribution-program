# Contribution Program Status

At this time, we're no longer accepting new submissions via the Contentful Contribution Program. We'll be closing out all outstanding articles and then archiving this repository. It's been great working with all of the authors who've submitted content these past two years. Unfortunately, our DevRel team doesn't have the bandwidth to provide the level of support that is genuinely necessary to make the Contribution Program successful. 

We'd still be happy to share any articles or tutorials that you write that include Contentful. Let us know via twitter or email (shy@contentful.com) about your content, and we'll share it via our socials and send you some swag. 

## What was the Contentful contribution program?

The Contentful contribution program gives you a platform to share your ideas with the Contentful community and the rest of the world. Let it be a blog post, a video tutorial or something we can not even think of, we want to hear from you and help you to create content that educates and inspires others to join the ["better way to build websites" movement](#what-does-building-better-websites-mean).

Our team of professional writers is there to support you in finding the best words and Contentful will distribute your piece so that it reaches the right people.

As a thank you, we will send you **a $250 Amazon voucher** and custom swag (socks, anyone?) and list you on [contentful.com](https://www.contentful.com) to make you a real Contentful community author.
